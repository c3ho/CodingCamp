This week we will expand a bit more on previous week lessons make a program that imitates a calculator.
The final program for this lesson is displayed in `calculator.js` file within the Week3 folder.

Before making the program let us think about how a calculator works.
1. It takes one number  
2. It takes an operator(+ , / , - , * )  
3. It takes another number  
4. It provides an output after performing the operation on both numbers

So this means we need three parameters right? one for the first number, one for the second number and one for the operator,

Let us write the first line of the function: 

`function calculator(firstNumber, secondNumber, operator) {`
