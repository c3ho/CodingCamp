# CodingCamp

For this coding camp we will be using Javascript and Glitch, the site for Glitch can be found [here](https://glitch.com/)

To get started, click on `New Project`, a dropdown will appear then click on `hello-express`.

To run any of the code we write into our files, they have to end with `.js`. Usually we name files
that describes whatever we're doing in the file. If I'm writing code to make a program say Hi, I might
name my file: `sayHi.js`

To Run any of the code written in a file, click on `Tools` in the bottom left corner of the page, then click on 
`Logs`, then `Console`. A black screen should appear, next to run the code we have inside a file we use :

`node filename`   

for example we have code in our file named `sayHi.js` we would type:  

`node sayHi.js`.
